      <h1>Isaac Garnand's coding portfolio</h1>
      <h4>Life experience - what brought me to code?</h4>
      <p>For my first job, at a company called Xtract Solutions, I bug tested the code for allergin-mixing software for allergists who practice immunotherapy. Testing the code meant running through the same process that nurses who mixed the solutions would go through; without mixing anything myself - I only checked to make sure the math worked. After working there for two years, I left, not seeing any advancement opporunities from a business with a very limited market-pool and no real growth stragety.</p>
      <p>But what should I do for work? College didn't seem like an option, but I was interested in vocational trades & physical labor jobs to make money. Nothing really stood out to me as a good long-term fit for me. There just simply isn't enough money paid out hourly to even the top earners of jobs thathave no real qualifications. It was in the aimless stupor of earning money through jobs that required no independent thought and degenetory waste of free-time that my despair was painful enough to motivate me to construct a vision of a future that didn't cause me to spend the present escaping reality.</p>
      <p>Coding, to me, could offer the assurance of a stable well-paying job with benefits, as well the potential for independently created minimal-capital startups opportunities that could transform into a working-life purpose of doing more than just laboring for the greater benifit of a business, that disregards employees easily replacable serfs.</p>
